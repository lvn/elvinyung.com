    <p>Hi. I'm Elvin Yung.</p>
    <p>I mostly <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shikaku.ramen/">make and eat a lot of ramen</a>. In my spare time, I 
      work at <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/">Modern Treasury</a>, making the 
      payments and banking infrastructure used by some of the world's largest fintechs.</p>
    <p> For five years before that, I was at <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/banking">Square Banking</a>,
      where I built out most of the banking stack.</p>

      It's all a question of imagination. Our responsibility begins with the power to imagine.
      It's just as Yeats said: In dreams begin responsibility. Turn this on its head and you could
      say that where there's no power to imagine, no responsibility can arise.
