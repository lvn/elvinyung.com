          <div class="infobox">
            <p>I'm an <del>aspiring</del> software developer who is generally proficient throughout most parts of the web stack, from frontend to backend, and with multiple technologies and platforms. I'm interested in building elegant and sustainable software architectures, deciding how different services and modules communicate with each other and the end-user, and how data is processed and exchanged between them.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I read up on information theory and computational linguistics. I also spend a lot of time thinking about interesting <a href="#do">side projects</a>, and possibly also building them.</p>
            <p>I attend hackathons quite frequently. I find the hackathon environment in general to be beneficial to productivity, and the saturation of knowledge, coming from other attendees, helps to enrich my knowledge.</p>
            <p>I currently attend the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>, in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, in the middle of the sophomore year of an Honours Computer Science Co-op program.</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I design, build and maintain software.</p>
        <p>I've worked at the following places before:</p>

            <h3>EventMobi</h3>
            <h4>Software Developer Intern</h4>
            <p>I worked at <a href="http://www.eventmobi.com/">EventMobi</a> in fall 2014, on the Full Stack Team, which was responsible for developing and maintaining essentially all of the user-facing application code, as well as the serverside middleware facade APIs. I mainly worked on a cross-platform push notifications system for native apps.</p>
            <p>My internship ended up, partially accidentally, being even more rewarding than I expected. I say accidentally because I was ostensibly brought on to do front-end (ish) work, and I ended up basically touching every part of the stack. So not only did I work extensively with <span class="thick">AngularJS</span>, I also gained a ton of experience with serverside development with <span class="thick">Python/Flask</span> and <span class="thick">Node.js/Express</span>. (And also a bit of PHP, but let's not talk about that.)</p>
            <p>Over the course of my internship, I did these things:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Implemented core infrastructure for an Amazon SNS-backed cross-platform push notifications system using Flask and Node.js</li>
              <li>Constructed Flask microservices for performing RESTful CRUD operations upon resources stored on Amazon S3</li>
              <li>Improved Grunt development build time for AngularJS apps by roughly 84% (135 seconds)</li>
              <li>Made various improvements to an internal Node.js build server</li>
              <li>Fixed major issues on AngularJS web-mobile apps and a PHP content management system</li>
              <li>Wrote unit tests for AngularJS apps with Karma and Sinon</li>
            </ul>

            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uberman">NPM</a> &middot; <a href="https://github.com/elvinyung/uberman">Github</a>
            <p>Uberman is a batteries-included framework for rapidly prototyping RESTful hypermedia-driven web data interfaces. It is written in Node.js, using Express as a middleware and routing framework.</p>
            <p>I was mainly inspired by the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html">Richardson Maturity Model</a>, and wanted to build a tool that could create arbitrary RESTful data APIs that are simultaneously compliant with the various RFC specifications, as well as Roy Fielding's <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">original dissertation</a>.</p>
            <p>Uberman features a pluggable data persistence layer, meaning that anyone using Uberman can ues any database they want, as long as they have an adapter for it.</p>

            <p>Pypress is a WSGI web framework written in Python. It started off as an attempt to emulate request routing powered by middleware stacking (à la Express, Sinatra, Martini, etc.) in Python.</p>
